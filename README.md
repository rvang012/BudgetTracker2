# BudgetTracker2

## Description
An application to track the User's budget when the User is on the go. The User will be able to track their budget while offline and will update when they come back online to the app.
Here is the deployed app: https://rocky-garden-99405.herokuapp.com/
## Usage
When the user opens the application, the user can input the object they're spending or subtracting on, input the amount and then select either the subtract to budget or add to budget.

## Challenges
I had some challenges with the db.js file. It was a lot of research and reverse engineering to figure out how that file worked with the other files.
